# 32CleanBeachesHardware

Microcontroller firmware for a beach cleaning robot. Project module at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences &amp; Arts.

Firmware written in C for a NXP MK22FN512VLH12 microcontroller. The TinyK22 module sits beside a Raspberry Pi 4 and acts as a realtime extension for it.

The firmware is based on the work of Christian Jost, a "TinyK22-RaspberryPi-UART-Bridge" for the course APROG (Advanced Programming).
